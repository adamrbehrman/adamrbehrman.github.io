# I like research.

I started undergraduate research when I was a freshman. When I came into Elon, I was accepted into the Elon College Fellows program, a four-year scholarship and undergraduate research program.

### Some background on Chroma

Chroma is a mobile application designed to teach absolute pitch through training sound-color associations like those found in synesthetes. 

I found my current mentor, Dr. Dugald Hutchings, while searching for someone with experience and passion in user experience. His prior research in HCI piqued my interest and supported my goalsas of creating a mobile application.

### The press

Elon University recently wrote [an article](https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2019/12/05/elon-college-fellows-poster-session-tells-the-story-of-elon/) about an undergraduate research poster presentation I spoke at.

![Here's](Elon College Fellows Research Poster.pdf) a copy of the poster I presented there.

And when I finally finish the research, I'll post a link to the app to download it on the App Store!
