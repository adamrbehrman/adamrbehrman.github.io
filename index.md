# Hi, I'm Adam. 

I'm a data-driven, results kind-of-guy who enjoys challenging work and solving meaningful problems. I plan to graduate December 2020.

You can see my research projects [here](https://adamrbehrman.github.io/research).


## Some of my personal projects:
### [An Othello solver](https://github.com/adamrbehrman/OthelloSolver)
- Spent some time thinking about how to 'solve' one of the most famous unsolved board games. This is what I came up with.

### [A Clue solver](https://github.com/adamrbehrman/ClueSolver)
- While playing 'Clue' with some friends, I thought it'd be a cool idea to write some code to help me beat them.

### [A Restaurant picker](https://github.com/adamrbehrman/Restaurant-Picker)
- Sometimes I don't know where to eat. Using a variety of sorting and searching methods, now I won't starve.

### [A Connect4 solver](https://github.com/adamrbehrman/Connect4Solver)
- Freshman year final project for Computer Science 1. It's pretty neato.
