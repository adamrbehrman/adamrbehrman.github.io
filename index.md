# Hi, I'm Adam. 

I'm a data-driven, results kind-of-guy who enjoys challenging work and solving meaningful problems. I currently work at Tresata, a fast-growing startup in Charlotte, NC. I graduated from Elon University Magna Cum Laude in December 2020.

## Some of my personal projects:
### [A Twitch statistics analytics tool](https://anaconda.org/adamrbehrman/twitch_analytics/notebook)
- I recently began streaming over on Twitch and wanted a better way to track my stats. This program also uses ML to predict how successful my next n streams will be.

### [An Othello solver](https://github.com/adamrbehrman/OthelloSolver)
- Spent some time thinking about how to 'solve' one of the most famous unsolved board games. This is what I came up with.

### [A Clue solver](https://github.com/adamrbehrman/ClueSolver)
- While playing 'Clue' with some friends, I thought it'd be a cool idea to write some code to help me beat them.

### [A Restaurant picker](https://github.com/adamrbehrman/Restaurant-Picker)
- Sometimes I don't know where to eat. Using a variety of sorting and searching methods, now I won't starve.

### [A Connect4 solver](https://github.com/adamrbehrman/Connect4Solver)
- Freshman year final project for Computer Science 1. It's pretty neato.
