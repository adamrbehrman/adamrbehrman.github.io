# A resume of sorts

Here is my digital resume, but I prefer to think of it as my 'Interest Page'.

## Some of the stuff I do

### Off-Campus
I'm a part-time data analyst for Minute.ly, a tech startup based in Tel-Aviv, Israel. 
In this role, I am responsible for:
- Conducting statistical analyses and experiments on user-engagement metrics
- Aggregating and analyzing client data to present key KPIs
- Creating visualizations to track and monitor key client data

### On-Campus Involvement
I'm an intern of Elon's Center for Organizational Analytics, Elon's hub for data analytics.

- [Team lead](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/business/organizational-analytics-center/interns/) of the HanesBrands project/Member of BeachRe project

I'm the founder and president of Club Table Tennis, Elon's newest club sport. This year, we've hosted [tournaments](https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2019/04/14/club-table-tennis-to-host-tournament-in-moseley-center-april-19) that reached over 100 people.

## Stuff I used to do

I think it's important to always be learning, and part of that is looking back. So, I want to show you some of the things I used to do.
- I was a tutor for Elon's Computer Science  curriculum. I got my CRLA certification (Level 1) in Spring 2019.
- I created and taught the Hour of Code class at Burlington Housing Authority's After-School Care. Through this, I was able to teach ~20 elemetary/middle schoolers how to create and deploy their own mobile applications using MIT App Inventor.



### TL;DR:
I'm a junior studying Computer Science at Elon University.

I have minors in Data Science and Statistics.

I do stuff on and off campus that I'm pretty proud of.

I believe data will change the world, and I want to lead that change.
