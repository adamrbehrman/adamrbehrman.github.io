# A resume of sorts
Here is my digital resume, but I prefer to think of it as my "Interest Page".
## The works

```
Programming/Scripting
• Python
• R
• Scala
• Java
• SQL
• SAS
• Swift
Data Wrangling
• AWS/HDFS
• Apache Zeppelin/Spark/Hadoop
• Firebase
Visualizations
• Tableau
• Kibana
```

Besides being a programmer, I'm also a clear communicator and strong leader. All throughout the time I've spent in the Data Science field, I have been challenged to learn and apply my knowledge at meetings, challenges and conferences. 

## Some of the stuff I do

### Work
Starting 2/1/2021, I began working at [Tresata](https://tresata.com), a unicorn based in Charlotte, NC.
In this role, I am responsible for:
- Cleaning of massive amounts of raw data, running queries, assessing and documenting data quality
- Writing custom cleaning processes, scripts, and workflows
- Tuning machine learning algorithms to perform record linkage, 
- Managing ES clusters, developing front-end visualizations and network graphs
- Running feedback loops and QA for resolution
- Integrating new data sources (both internal & external)

Tools used: Scala, Spark, Hadoop, and other large data processing tools

### Off-Campus

From 6/1/2020 - 8/7/2020, I was a Data Engineer intern at [Tresata](https://tresata.com).
In this role, I was responsible for:
- Leading several projects (including 2 presentations to the CEO & COO)
- Identifying and analyzing ML solutions for address parsing (check out [Libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal))
- Downloading/uploading 20+ large datasets related to Covid-19 and curating them

From 6/10/2019 - 5/20/2020, I was a part-time data analyst for [Minute.ly](https://www.minute.ly), a tech startup based in Tel-Aviv, Israel. 
In this role, I was responsible for:
- Conducting statistical analyses and experiments on user-engagement metrics
- Aggregating and analyzing client data to present key KPIs
- Creating visualizations to track and monitor key client data
- Creating and delivering performance reports for clients

### On-Campus Involvement

I was an intern of Elon's Center for Organizational Analytics, Elon's hub for data analytics.

- [Team lead](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/business/organizational-analytics-center/interns/) of the HanesBrands project/Member of BeachRe project (2019)

I was the founder and president of Club Table Tennis, Elon's newest club sport. In 2019 we hosted [tournaments](https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2019/04/14/club-table-tennis-to-host-tournament-in-moseley-center-april-19) that reached over 100 people and have build up a membership from 0 to 100+.
Here's what the press has to say about us:

- [Our university's president](https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2019/11/18/table-tennis-more-than-just-a-game-for-president-book) playing ping pong with us

## Stuff I used to do

I think it's important to always be learning, and part of that is looking back. 
Here's some of the things I previously did:
- I was a tutor for Elon's Computer Science  curriculum. I got my CRLA certification (Level 1) in Spring 2019.
- I created and taught a mobile application development class at Burlington Housing Authority's After-School Care. Through this, I was able to teach ~20 elemetary/middle schoolers how to create and deploy their own mobile applications using MIT App Inventor.

## Hobbies

I enjoy life a lot. Here are some of the things I like to do the most while I'm here on Earth:
- I am an avid origamist (yes, it's a word). Here's my origami [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lohfi_tv/)
- I stream on Twitch (shameless plug for [my Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lohfi_tv))
- I love my research ([here's the website](https://adamrbehrman.github.io/chroma.github.io/privacy-policy))
- I played competitive club tennis at Elon (in 2018, we won 2nd place in the backdraw ofthe USTA Tennis on Campus Fall Invitational at Cary, NC)

### TL;DR:

I'm a Data Engineer at Tresata, a fast-growing unicorn in Charlotte, NC.

I graduated Magna Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Elon University (gpa: 3.88).

I believe data will change the world, and I want to help lead that change.
